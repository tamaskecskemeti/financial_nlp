# financial_nlp
* The initial task is to create and fine-tune NLP models from Hugging Face in order to generate financial texts with masking recognized identities with an additional NER model.
* For the basic, fine-tuning (GaLore) and NER model a separate Python notebook is used
 
The data used for fine-tuning comes from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jeet2016/us-financial-news-articles/.
The documentation can be accessed at: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RGOT1PM_lnP2WTJPAny2_IJZbHowN3PQmQQDypgzGkg/edit?usp=sharing
